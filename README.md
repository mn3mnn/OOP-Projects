# Top-Ten-list OOP

## PB statement :

Write a program that manages a list of up to 10 players and their high scores in the computer’s memory.
Use suitable arrays, vector and/or structures to manage the list. 

Your program should support the
following features:

(a) Add a new player and score. If it is one of the top 10 scores then add it to the list of scores and
remove the player with the smallest score. The same name and score can appear multiple times. For
example, if Bill played 3 times and scored 100, 100, and 99, and Bob played once and scored 50,
then the top scores would be Bill 100, Bill 100, Bill 99, Bob 50.

(b) Print the top 10 names and scores to the screen sorted by score with the highest score first.

(c) Allow the user to enter a player name and output that player’s highest score if it is on the top 10 list
or a message if the player’s name has not been input or is not in the top 10.

(d) Create a menu system that allows the user to select which option to invoke.
